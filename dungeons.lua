First thing: you can get a buff from Dragonflight Recruiters, get what you need (vers is red)

Overgrown Ancient:

Stack on tank, during germination we need to move clockwise, our left, avoiding spawns.

The first and third germination is harmless, flowers can be killed without using cooldowns. The second and fourth is dangerous, we need to kill active flowers as soon as possible. Auto attacks stack a poison.

After germination the boss spawns a treant, it's cast Regrowth, must be kicked or silenced.
While alive it afflicts everyone with a bleed, can't be cleansed. When killed the treant spawns a green aoe, it cleans the stacks of it's own bleed and the poison coming from the flowers auto attack, stay inside for 3 seconds.

Defensives after the second and fourth germination.
